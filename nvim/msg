I often change my environment so i made nix-shell setup with neovim configuration and placed it in tarball on remote server so i can easly use one command and get my nvim on every machine with nix

but i'm tired of creating nix-shell on my nixos system every time i want to use neovim.

Is there any way to import it from configuration.nix?
I know it creates shell with `mkShell` so it's logically impossible to link it directly to nixos configuration

for now my shell nix file looks something like that:

```nix
let 
  customNvim = pkgs.neovim.override {
    ...
  };
in
pkgs.mkShell{
  buildInputs =[ customNvim ... ];
}
``` 

I thought about seperate "let" section to another nix file and import it from shell nix file 
so i could import only customNvim from nixos configuration.nix file without mkShell section

but i feel stupid with that and don't know how to do it correctly
